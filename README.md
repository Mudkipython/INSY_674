# INSY 695: Enterprise Data Science & ML in Production I - Final Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains the final group project for **INSY 695** at the Desautels Faculty of Management. The objective is to implement a sustainable, scalable, and enterprise-grade Artificial Intelligence (AI) product by following the end-to-end data science lifecycle.

## 🛠 Enterprise Tech Stack
This project utilizes the mandated enterprise tools and frameworks:
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Microsoft Azure.
* **Containerization:** Docker.
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes.
* **Distributed Computing:** Databricks / Apache Spark.
* **Development Environment:** PyCharm with Python Dev Tools (`pytest`, `black`, `mypy`, `flake8`).
* **Machine Learning Stack:** * Core: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn.
    * Deep Learning: Keras, TensorFlow.
    * AutoML: H2O.ai, TPOT, or AutoKeras.
* **Governance & Explainability:** LIME and SHAP libraries.
* **Causal Inference:** EconML.



## 🏗 Project Structure & Deliverables
To meet the evaluation criteria, the repository is organized as follows:
* `/data`: Contains the raw dataset in `.csv` or `.json` format.
* `/notebooks`: Includes the Jupyter or Databricks notebook (`.ipynb` or `.dbc`) with code, diagrams, and markdown documentation.
* `/submission`: Contains the exported HTML version of the notebook with results.
* `README.md`: This file, documenting the project scope and team members.

## 🚀 Reproducibility Requirements
In accordance with course standards, all experiments must be reproducible:
1. All data transformations, preparation, and modeling must be performed within the submitted notebook.
2. All project activities must be logged in GitHub.
3. The electronic submission must list all group members.

## 👥 Group Members
* Yuyang Chen
* Zhaihan Gong
* Yujia Sun
* Zihan Xu
* Ruihe Zhang

## ⚖️ Grading
This project accounts for **45%** of the final course grade:
* **Final Presentation:** 15% (15-minute presentation + Q&A).
* **Final Submission:** 30%.
